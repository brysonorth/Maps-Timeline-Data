# Maps-Timeline-Data
Gathers data from Google Maps Takeout zip file and returns travel info
Takes JSON files from Google Maps Taekout zip, parses and returns info for chosen months. 
Gives statistics for selected month about total distance, total duration travelling, longest trips, furthest trips, car/plane gas used, carbon footprint and cost of car gas
Google maps takeout is not an API so a download is necessary and some minor changes to the code for eah individual. currently works for my file path only.
